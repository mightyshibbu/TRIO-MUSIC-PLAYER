# TRIO-MUSIC-PLAYER
Programme to illustrate the basic use of data structure.

The Trio-Music-Player is a Python-based music playlist queue selector that demonstrates the fundamental use of a linked list data structure. This program enables users to manage a music playlist by adding songs, displaying the playlist, and executing various playback sequences such as quick play, alternate play, looping, and shuffle functionalities. The user interface operates via a command-line interface (CLI), presenting a menu of options for interacting with the playlist. Users can add songs to the playlist, view the existing playlist, play songs in different sequences, and exit the application as desired. The program incorporates functionalities for adding songs, playing songs randomly or sequentially, checking for an empty playlist, and controlling playback sequences. The implementation showcases the use of linked lists to manage and manipulate a music playlist efficiently.
